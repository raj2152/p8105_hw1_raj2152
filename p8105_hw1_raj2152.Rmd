```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

First, create a data frame and show resulting output table.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

df = tibble(
  rand_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vec = rand_sample > 0,
  char_vec = vector("character", 10),
  factor_vec = factor(x = character(10),3)
)

df
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in the data frame, after pulling each one:
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
pull(df,rand_sample)
mean(rand_sample)
pull(df,logical_vec)
mean(logical_vec)
pull(df,char_vec)
mean(char_vec)
pull(df,factor_vec)
mean(factor_vec)
```


I could only get the mean for rand_sample (mean=-0.22), but not the logical, character, or factor variables.
