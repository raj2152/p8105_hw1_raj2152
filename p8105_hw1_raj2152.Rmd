```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

First, create a data frame and show resulting output table.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

df = tibble(
  rand_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vec = rand_sample > 0,
  char_vec = vector("character", 10),
  factor_vec = factor(x = character(10),3)
)

df
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in the data frame, after pulling each one:
```{r}
mean(pull(df,rand_sample))
mean(pull(df,logical_vec))
mean(pull(df,char_vec))
mean(pull(df,factor_vec))
```

I could only get the mean for rand_sample and the logical_vec variables. The character and factor variables returned 'NA' and gave a warning that the argument is not numeric or logical.
